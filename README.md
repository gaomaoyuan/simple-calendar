# Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

WHEN I scroll down, it shows the standrad business hours.

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past in grey, present in red, or future in green.

WHEN I click into a time block, I can enter a event.

WHEN I click the save button for that time block, it will be saved in local storage.

WHEN I refresh the page, it will saved the text.
